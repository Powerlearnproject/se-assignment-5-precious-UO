          Steps to Download and Install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11

      Prerequisites include an operating System(Windows 11), an internet Connection, and administrator Privileges.


      Step 1: Open your preferred web browser and go to the official Visual Studio Code website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

      Step 2: On the homepage, you will see a "Download" button that automatically detects your operating system. Click on the "Download for Windows" button. This will download the installer (`VSCodeUserSetup-x64-x.x.x.exe`).

      Step 3: Once the download is complete, navigate to your downloads folder and double-click on the downloaded installer file (`VSCodeUserSetup-x64-x.x.x.exe`).

      Step 4: 
         - A User Account Control (UAC) prompt may appear asking for permission to make changes to your device. Click "Yes" to proceed.
         - The Visual Studio Code Setup wizard will open. Click "Next" to start the installation process.

      Step 5: Read through the license agreement. If you agree, select "I accept the agreement" and click "Next."

      Step 6: Choose the destination folder where you want Visual Studio Code to be installed. Then click "Next" to continue.

      Step 7: 
         - You will be prompted to select additional tasks. These include:
           - Creating a desktop icon.
           - Adding "Open with Code" actions to the context menu for files and directories.
           - Registering VS Code as an editor for supported file types.
           - Adding to PATH (this allows you to open VS Code from the command line).
         - Choose the options that suit your needs and click "Next."

      Step 8: Review your selections and click "Install" to begin the installation. 

      Step 9: Once the installation is complete, you will see a final screen. Ensure the "Launch Visual Studio Code" option is
              checked if you want to open it immediately, and click "Finish."

Question Seven: Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. 
                What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?

      The integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows you to run command-line programs from within the editor, which streamlines your 
      workflow and keeps all your development tasks in one place.
      
      Opening the Integrated Terminal
      
      1. Using the Menu:
         - Go to `View > Terminal` in the top menu.
         
      2. Using the Activity Bar:
         - Click the Terminal icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
         
      3. Using Keyboard Shortcuts:
         - Press `Ctrl+` (backtick) on Windows/Linux.
         - Press `Cmd+` (backtick) on macOS.
      
      Using the Integrated Terminal
      
      1. Creating New Terminals:
         - Click the `+` icon in the terminal panel to open a new terminal instance.
         - Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+` (backtick) on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+` (backtick) on macOS.
      
      2. Navigating Between Terminals:
         - Use the dropdown menu in the terminal panel to switch between open terminal instances.
         - You can also navigate using `Ctrl+` (backtick) to cycle through terminals.
      
      3. Splitting Terminals:
         - Click the split terminal icon in the terminal panel to split the current terminal into multiple panes.
         - Each pane operates independently, allowing you to run multiple command-line tasks simultaneously.
      
      4. Renaming Terminals:
         - Right-click on the terminal tab and select `Rename` to give the terminal a custom name.
         - This helps in organizing multiple terminals.
      
      5. Running Commands:
         - Enter your command as you would in any command-line interface and press Enter.
         - The output of the command will be displayed in the terminal window.
      
      6. Terminal Settings:
         - Customize terminal settings by going to `File > Preferences > Settings` and searching for "terminal".
         - Options include setting the default shell, font size, cursor style, and more.
      
      Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal
      
      1. Convenience and Integration:
         - Single Environment: Keep all your development tasks (coding, running scripts, version control) in one place without needing to switch between applications.
         - Workspace Awareness: The integrated terminal opens with the working directory set to the root of your workspace, making it easy to run project-specific commands.
      
      2. Synchronization with the Editor:
         - Context Awareness: Errors and outputs in the terminal can be clicked to navigate directly to the corresponding line in the code editor.
         - Shared Environment: Environment variables and configurations can be shared between the terminal and the editor, ensuring consistency.
      
      3. Multiple Terminals:
         - Easily Manage Multiple Sessions: Open and manage multiple terminal instances within the same window. Each terminal can run different commands or tasks simultaneously.
         - Split Terminals: Split terminals to view and manage multiple command-line tasks side-by-side.
      
      4. Customization:
         - Appearance and Behavior: Customize the look and behavior of the terminal to match your preferences and needs, including shell type, font, colors, and more.
         - Profiles: Set up different profiles for different shells or environments (e.g., bash, PowerShell, zsh).
      
      5. Efficient Workflow:
         - Integrated with Extensions: Many VS Code extensions interact with the integrated terminal, providing additional functionality like running tests, building projects, or deploying applications directly from the terminal.
         - Keybindings and Commands: Use VS Code keybindings and commands to control the terminal, improving efficiency and reducing the need for mouse interactions.
